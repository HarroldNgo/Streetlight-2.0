            <p class="name-description">The "Streetlight" was a metaphor used by a character named Usnavi from a broadway called "In The Heights" written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes. The "Streetlight" is depicted as a negative metaphor, an inanimate object stuck to the sides of every street. It represented the characters' path- stuck in the same spot serving the same purpose as time goes on. As the characters face various challenges and changes, the metaphor of the streetlight is used to
              convey the idea of guidance, hope, and continuity. Welcome to The Streetlight where we illuminate the stories of the people of the street.
